    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Turkish breakfast favorite, Simit is a circular bread, typically encrusted with sesame seeds or, less commonly, poppy, flax or sunflower seeds, found across the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, Turkey.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup molasses</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit until frothy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until dough comes together. Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope, about 12 inches long. Shape into a circle, overlapping ends by 1 inch. Place on prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix molasses and water. Brush over simit. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
